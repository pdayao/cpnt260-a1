    <h2> How to make silken tofu</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Soak <em>dried soybeans</em> overnight.</li>
      <li>Remove soybean skin.</li>
      <li>In a high speed blender, blend water and soybeans (1:1 ratio).</li>
      <li>Using a nutbag, separate pulp and soy milk.</li>
      <li>In a large pot, heat soymilk on <strong>low</strong> to 85 C while stirring. <em>This will prevent the soy milk from burning while it is being heated. </em></li>
      <li>Transfer soy milk into a new container and gently stir in coagulant of choice.</li>
      <li>Cover container and let sit for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Serve warm or chilled.</li>
    </ol>
  
    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <p>While lemon juice and other citrus additives could work as a coagulant, it will not result in the same smooth texture that silken tofu is known for so using a salt coagulant would work best. It is not recommended to use store bought soy milk to make tofu as they contain preservatives and a much lower protein content than freshly made soy milk (lower protein content = less tofu produced). Soy bean pulp (also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okara_(food)">Okara</a>) can be used in other recipes. They can be added to desserts, blended drinks, and used as an ingredient for protein substitutes!</p>
